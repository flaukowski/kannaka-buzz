/**
 * The crest actually reaches the page.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * The crest is injected at runtime by features/kannaka/mount.ts rather than
 * imported by a component, which is what stopped it conflicting on every
 * upstream sync. The cost of that trade is that every way it can break is
 * SILENT: a renamed asset, a dropped script tag in index.html, a `:has()`
 * anchor that no longer matches — none of them throw. The build stays green and
 * onboarding just quietly looks like stock Buzz.
 *
 * check-kannaka-theme.mjs asserts the chain is wired and mount.test.mjs asserts
 * the injection logic, but neither observes a real page. Until this spec existed
 * nothing in CI would have caught the crest simply being absent.
 *
 * Lives in its own file on purpose: our brand pins inside upstream's
 * identity-lost.spec.ts are themselves a recurring merge-conflict surface, and
 * a Kannaka-owned spec adds none.

  // tolerance until the real failure could slip through too.

  // Returns the WORST deviation across all three geometric claims so one poll
  // covers them together:
  //   - width/x: the crest spans the artwork. Drift here means
  //     `min(100%, 600px)` stopped tracking upstream's `w-full max-w-[600px]`.
  //   - lift: the crown rises above the artwork by exactly the headroom. This
  //     is the load-bearing one — it proves the translateY resolved against the
  //     crest's own height and not the parent flex column's, which is the bug
  //     that would put the crown somewhere unrelated. Resolving against the
